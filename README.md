Project 3 - CS-210 Summary

- This project combines both the C++ and Python programming languages working 
together under one visual studio project. The project takes an input text file
with a large number of grocery items and allows the user to display information 
about the text file through a numbered console menu. The use of Python with C++
solves the issue of working with large unknown sets of data, playing to the 
strengths of python and avoiding unneccary complexities that can come from using
C++.

- Something the program does particularly well is breaking down the algorithim work
in the python section of the code. Saving important list elements in variables with
helpful names makes the more intimidating areas easier to understand.

- Enhancements to the code might enclude breaking the functionality of the C++ into 
functions for code reusability and to make it less prone to bugs as well.

- Transferable skills from this project would include things like code formatting, and
debugging. Learning to make problems smaller and work through more complex tasks should 
come in handy on other projects.

- The code has been formatted with comments and whitespace to make the readability
of the code easier. All of the algorithim work done via python can be adjusted without
any of the C++ code breaking as well. Additionally more python functions can be added as
needed and called by the C++ wrapper functions provided.
